- Austin Ziegler created Hoe::Halostatue.

It would not be possible without Ryan Davis's [Hoe][hoe] and depends on the work
of others in the Ruby community:

- James Tucker (@raggi) for [`hoe-gemspec2`][hoe-gemspec2]
- James Barnette (@jbarnette) for [`hoe-doofus`][hoe-doofus],
  [`hoe-git2`][hoe-git2], and [`hoe-rubygems`][hoe-rubygems]
- Mike Dalessio (@flavorjones) for [`hoe-markdown`][hoe-markdown]
- Samuel Giddins (@segiddins) for providing the inspiration to make all of this
  work better for trusted publishing for RubyGems.
